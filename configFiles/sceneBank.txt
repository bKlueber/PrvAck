003|A crack Runs Across Reality in Front of The Colony. Sirens Wail, But No One is There to Hear it. The AI Are Alone to Make Glimpses And Stare Into The Abyss Beyond. It Looks Back.|Wake up->004,Keep Dreaming->005

015|'You made it out,' She Says Softly. 'I thought no one else would,' She Hands You a Crust of Bread.|What Happened to The Colony?->017,What's Going on?->017
016|The Catwalk Ends in Rubble. You Can See The Market Beyond, But No Clear Path.|Try to Jump->018,Return to The Old Lady->015
017|'It wasn't always like this,' She Murmurs. 'You want answers? Go find Ligart. He knows more than he lets on.'|Who's Ligart?->019,Where Can I Find him?->018
018|'Come with me, he's in the market,' She Began. 'However, it's quite tricky to get to from here, so pay attention and follow closely,' the Old Lady Explained, Waddling Off With Cane in Hand.|Follow Her->020
019|'He's a dealer of information, a tricky man, indeed,' She Babbled. 'Shady deals and dirty money, but the only broker of information around as good as him,' She Admitted.|Where Can I Find him?->018
020|The Old Lady Leads You Through the Scaffolding Mess Beyond the Pod Bay. Reaching a Different Elevation But Same Ending Rubble of the Catwalk.|Continue->021
021|Small Gaps in the Messy Ruin Can Be Seen From This Position, But Nothing Else Was Below the Catwalk From Here. Leading to a Pit With No Visible Bottom.|Are You sure About This?->022
022|'I've Been Doing This For Years,' She Scoffed. 'Just do as I do, and You'll be Fine,' She Explained. 'Oh, and maybe don't look down,' the Old Lady Teased.|Whatever You Say->023,Follow Her->-23

027|You Wander Through the Stalls, Dusty and Cracked, But Some Look Recently Disturbed. A Faint Voice Calls From Behind a Curtain.|Investigate The Voice->028,Keep Walking->029
028|The Old Lady Waved You Over Again. 'Before You Go Asking Questions, How About a Favor? My Water Filter's Busted,' She Said, Holding Up a Rusty Device.|Take The Filter->030,Refuse->031
029|Wandering Deeper into the Market Without Guidance, You Begin to Draw Unwanted Attention. Eyes Follow Your Movements. Whispers Stir.|Go Back to The Old Lady->028,Push Onward Anyway->032
030|'Good. You'll Find a Spare in the Lower Stall Beneath the Windtrap,' She Instructs. 'Watch Your Step Down There. Not All Are Friendly.'|Begin The Task->033
031|'Suit Yourself,' She Huffs. 'Don't Expect Me to Point You Anywhere Then.'|Wander Stalls->029,Take Filter->030

032|You Push Deeper Into a Darker Corner of the Market. A Man Blocks Your Way, Covered in Grafted Tech and Scraps. 'You Lost?' He Growls.|Confront Him->034,Turn Back->028
033|You Descend a Rusty Ladder Into a Hidden Nook Beneath the Market. Water Drips From Overhead. The Windtrap Moans.|Search The Debris->035,Look Around First->036
034|The Man Shoves You. 'Best Head Back to the Old Hag, Newblood,' He Warns, Then Laughs. You Get the Feeling He Let You Off Easy.|Retreat to The Market->026

035|You Find a Spare Filter Among Wires and Rot. It's Damaged, But Might Be Repairable.|Take It Back->037
036|You Spot an Old Toolbench and a Crate of Parts Nearby. It Could Be Used to Repair the Filter.|Try to Repair Filter->038,Take It As-Is->035
037|The Old Lady Smiles. 'Well Done. You're Not Useless After All,' She Says. 'Here, Take This,' She Hands You a Strange Token.|Ask What It Is->039,Thank Her and Leave->040
038|With Patience and a Bit of Luck, You Patch the Filter. The Old Lady Is Pleased. 'Smart and Handy. Rare Combo Here,' She Grins.|Give Filter->037

039|'That Token? It's How You'll Pay Ligart,' She Explains. 'He Doesn't Take Coin—Only Questions Worth Asking.'|Where Is He Again?->041
040|'Off You Go,' She Says, Already Tinkering With the Filter. 'And Watch Yourself With Ligart. He's...different.'|Search For Ligart->041
041|You Make Your Way Past the Market's Edge, Past Vendors and Roving Thugs. You Find a Quiet Corner Where a Young Man Watches From a Shaded Alcove.|Approach The Man->042

042|He's Lean, Pale, and Dressed Like a Vendor, But There's No Goods—Only a Stack of Books and a Dim Lamp. 'You've Got Questions?' He Asks Without Looking Up.|Offer Token->043,Who Are You?->044
043|He Takes the Token and Pockets It Silently. 'What You Want to Know, Stranger?' He Leans Forward, His Eyes Dark as the Void.|Ask About The Colony->045
044|'Name's Vicar Ligart. I Listen, I Speak, I Trade. That's What You Need to Know,' He Says Flatly While Laying the Book He Was Looking Over Off to the Side.|Offer Token->043
045|'Ah, Erebus-9? Talk around the colony says we're not anywhere at all,' Ligart Began.|Continue->046
046|'Pretty crazy, right? I know... The engineers say the AI looked into the Abyss first and it looked back,' he Continued.|What Happened?->047
047|'No one's sure why or how we got here,' Ligart Shrugged. 'What we do know is that they saw it first, and some went crazy,' He Added.|Continue->048
048|'Bing, Bang, Boom. We're here now,' Ligart Explained.|Thanks->050
049|*[No scene provided for ID 049]*|
050|'No sweat kid, if you got more tokens and have more questions, I'll be here.'|Return to Market->026

051|You've Earned Vicar's Trust. The Market Opens to You, But Only Partially. He Has a Task.|Continue->052
